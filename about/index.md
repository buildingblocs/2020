# About

### What is BuildingBloCS??
BuildlingBloCS is a yearlong outreach programme for students, by students! Activities and workshops will be conducted by JC Computing students, guided by their teachers, to educate people around the nation about the wonders of Computing, and spread its love :3. Activities need not be entirely technical, and they can be something like creatively integrating Computing concepts into usual activities!

### Changes this year
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is illegal to physically hold inter-school workshops and activities. Therefore, most of our workshops and activities will have to be conducted online! On hindsight, this allows for flexibility and allows more people to join because they can do it from home.

## Fringe Games

We have **8 exciting games** lined up for you in BuildingBloCS 2018- From decoding secret passages, to solving puzzles, the possibilities are boundless! 
Participants will be pushed to work together and compete against other teams in a race against time.

Details and instructions of the fringe games will be released on the day itself for an element of surprise. **The Best Performing Team will win attractive prizes ;)**
