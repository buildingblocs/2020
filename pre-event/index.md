## DataCamp Outreach Workshop
Data science and artificial intelligence have become hot topics ubiquitous in almost all industries such as business, education, healthcare, security, etc. The list never ends! 

Held on the 15th April 2020, participants had the opportunity to learn about these topics through DataCamp.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a platform that allows you to learn about data science, machine learning, etc. It comes in courses conducted by industry experts with bite-size exercises accompanied by clear instructional videos. Users can learn data analytics and machine learning from the comfort of their browser, at their own pace, and tailored to their needs and expertise, and even earn industry certification!
