> ## Invitation to participate in BuildingBloCS 2020, Singapore's largest for students by students Computing education outreach programme.  

<br><br>
This year, BuildingBloCS is going ONLINE! We would like to invite all Computing students and students interested in Computing to join us for two exciting half days of fun, learning and friendship.  

**We have a Discord server!**  
We would be posting regular updates through the server and it would be the easiest and quickest way to get the most up-to-date information regarding upcoming BuildingBloCS events and workshops! (Discord link would be sent to you upon signing up)

  <summary><strong>1: CodeCombat</strong></summary><br>
  CodeCombat is an online multiplayer game that requires players to utilise code to complete various levels. Unlike typical games which are rigidly based on superficial input, CodeCombat centers itself on tasking players to directly script and code the behaviours of their characters. No WASD keys, R1 to fire, etc. CodeCombat is of a higher level. Code to conquer. Ctrl W to quit.

<summary><strong>2: The Amazing Race</strong></summary><br>
Participate in an Amazing Race style online competition with multiple stages and tasks based on computing related topics. Participants will be working in groups to tackle a variety of programming problems, each relating to a H2 Computing topic or BBCS workshop. At the end of each stage, participants will play a little scavenger hunt to look for the hidden password which will eventually unlock the final puzzle. Members will have to work together to overcome these unique programming tasks.

<br>
**Apart from the conference, there are also other online activities to sign up:**   

<br>
## BBCS X Games  

Learn programming in a fun and interactive way through our CodeCombat tournament and The Amazing Race! Choose to compete in the Introduction Python or JavaScript courses in CodeCombat and participate in The Amazing that introduces many computing concepts such as computational thinking, databases and many more!  

<sup>**P.S.
There are lots of attractive prizes to be won so sign up for both days of the main conference to take part in these games! :)**</sup> 

<br>
## BBCS X Baking  

Cookies! Do they sound like yummy snacks? Well, they can also be fun to code!

In this workshop, you will be learning some interesting computing concepts integrating baking as a metaphor! By relating baking in real life to coding, we will be able to create some cool personalised cookies!  

***Yes we have baking!***    

<br>
## BBCS X Coursemology  

Do you want to further your knowledge in Python? Sign up for Coursemology to gain access to many interactive programming courses, covering a variety of topics from basic syntax to data visualisation and manipulation!

Every topic is made easy to understand through a series of questions that systematically guide your thinking process, allowing you to apply the mathematical concepts you already know in unique and interesting ways, and fun and exciting storylines allowing you to see applications of such knowledge in the real world.


<sup>**P.S. The top 5 scorers of the year get some spicy prizes!**</sup>

## BBCS X Workshops  

Have you ever wanted to learn about lane detection (OpenCV), or build your own website (Flask)? 

We have a host of workshops awaiting you to cater to your varying interests! Enter the realm of cyber-defenders by taking on a hands-on approach to cybersecurity, or learn how to use SQLite/NoSQL to enrich your web/mobile applications! If you are looking to refresh your programming knowledge/thinking, do drop by the Intro to Python Workshop! Aspiring game developers, you’ll be glad to know that Intro to Unity Workshop awaits you while those eager to enhance your project workflow should partake in the Intro to Git session.

## BBCS X Lucky Draw  

Are you feeling lucky? Participants earn chances to win in regular lucky dips by participating in the various BuildingBloCS activities such as Coursemology, DataCamp, games, workshops and more. The more you participate, the luckier you get! And it is not only about prizes, you learn Computing knowledge and skills while we conduct our lucky draws too!<br>

<br>
## BBCS X Entertainment  

Afraid you'll be bored by pure coding lingo and activities? (Though our activities are definitely not boring but) Fret not! We'll be having fun stuff along the way to liven up your experience! Look out for coding jokes, fun games and videos, and even mini competitions! Life is fun! 

*An example to get you going:<br>
A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.4 root beers. The bartender says "I'll have to charge you extra, that's a root beer float"*

<br><br><br>
> **All events are free and limited places are available. Students can register at BuildingBloCS.github.io.**<br><br>
> **Those who are actively engaged will get to win attractive lucky draw prizes. :)**  

*One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.*
